## Notes app in Node

Another notes app I created to try out express, Add, edit delete notes.

### Backend

Written in JS(Node) using express and Mongoose . Sessions are handled via JWT, Passwords are hashed and endpoints require auth to use. Sessions are stored in the DB (I know, I know).

### Frontend

Written in JS using the React, Redux, React-Redux, Redux-Thunk, Styled-Components and React-Router.

Backend communicates with a MongoDB instance.
